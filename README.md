NBA in-depth data analysis

This project is a R-Shiny project aiming at displaying simple, nice and interactive graphs.
It is based on play-by-play datasets bought to a third company.

The link of the full app is: https://stat-ib.shinyapps.io/shiny/

WARNING: On this Github repo, there is only a sample of original datas (few games of the 2020-2021 season).
You can launch the app locally by opening the R project NBAstats and then writing the two lines of code in the console
> library(shiny)
> runApp(appDir = "Shiny")

Access to the complete datasets is subject to discussion with me thibaut.charre.tc@gmail.Com
Also, if you want to discuss application improvements I will be delighted to do it.

Enjoy !!!!!
