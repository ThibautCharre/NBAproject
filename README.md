NBA in-depth data analysis

This project is a R-Shiny project aiming at displaying simple, nice and interactive graphs.
It is based on play-by-play datasets bought to a third company (BigData Ball).

The link of the project is: https://stat-ib.shinyapps.io/shiny/

WARNING: The code and the app structure is in the Github repository BUT datas are not accessible, 
hence, app will not work if you DL the project and launch it locally.
Access to the datas is to be discussed with me thibaut.charre.tc@gmail.Com
